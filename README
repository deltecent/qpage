	QuickPage is a software package used for sending text messages
	to an alpha-numeric pager.  I wrote it because I couldn't find
	another package I was satisfied with.  QuickPage was developed
	specifically for Solaris 2.x but I tried to make the code as
	portable as possible so it should compile just fine on other
	operating systems.

	QuickPage is available to the internet community free of charge
	for non-commercial use.  That is, you may use and copy QuickPage
	but you may not sell QuickPage or any derivation thereof to any
        third party without express written permission from the author.
	Please read the LICENSE agreement included in this package for
	more information.

	If you would like to be notified of future QuickPage releases,
	let me know and I'll add you to my announcement list.  It is
	not a discussion list--it will be used only by me and only for
	sending announcements regarding QuickPage.  Don't worry, I hate
	spam just as much as anyone else.


	Enjoy!
