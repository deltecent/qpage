    I'd like to thank the following people for providing me with
    valuable feedback during the development of QuickPage:

		    Bob Landsparger
		    David Maislin
		    Doron Shikmoni
		    Wojciech Tryc
		    Jason Austin
		    Mike Williams
		    Patrick Ryan

    Special thanks go to Alex Morris in Tucson, AZ who went way
    beyond kindness by donating a PC system complete with Linux
    already installed so that I would have more that just Solaris
    as a development platform.

    Thanks also to everyone who has sent me comments, suggestions,
    and bug fixes.  Keep up the good work.  Finally, thanks to my
    wife Ginger for putting up with my late nights in front of the
    computer.
