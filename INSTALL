	Installation instructions for QuickPage v3.3:
	---------------------------------------------

1) Make sure you have the latest version.  The latest version of QuickPage
   can be found at http://www.qpage.org/.

2) Edit config.input as appropriate and type "./configure" in this
   directory.

3) Type "make" to build the QuickPage binary, or type "make client" for a
   stripped down client-only version.

4) Install qpage and qpage.man in appropriate directories.

5) Create a run-time configuration file.  See the man page for complete
   details on the syntax of this file.

6) Edit the appropriate system startup file to start a QuickPage daemon
   process when the system boots.

7) Send e-mail to tomiii@qpage.org telling me how you like QuickPage!  :-)

	How to use the "tcp_wrappers" package with QuickPage:
	-----------------------------------------------------

QuickPage has builtin support for Wietse Venema's "tcp_wrappers" package.
If you don't know what this means, forget about it and skip to the next
section.  The "configure" script in this directory automatically checks
for the presence of tcpd.h and libwrap.a on your system and will make
appropriate changes to QuickPage's Makefile if they are found.  However,
as Tony Dal Santo likes to say, "There is no magic."  You might need to
give the configure script a little help.  It will try to compile and link
this program:

    #include "tcpd.h"
    int main()
    {
        request_init(0);
        return(0);
    }

In doing so, it will look for tcpd.h and libwrap.a in a variety of places
including those specified by --includedir and --libdir (respectively) and
in the current directory.  If this program compiles and links successfully,
QuickPage will be configured for tcp_wrapper support.  If "configure"
cannot find both tcpd.h and libwrap.a then you have three options:

    1) copy those files to this directory and rerun "./configure"

    2) run "./configure" with appropriate --includedir and --libdir
       options

    3) You didn't really want to use tcp_wrappers, did you?

If you have trouble, please send e-mail to tomiii@qpage.org explaining
your problem.

	How to integrate QuickPage into your e-mail system:
	---------------------------------------------------

There are many ways to integrate QuickPage into your e-mail system.  None
of them require running a QuickPage daemon on your mail server.  Two
common methods of using QuickPage via e-mail without requiring changes
to sendmail.cf are:

1) Create aliases for each user, such as:

	<user>-page: "|/usr/local/bin/qpage -l 0 -m -p <user>"

   Sending messages to <user>-page will result in the message being
   forwarded to the user's pager.

2) Install the procmail package from ftp.informatik.rwth-aachen.de.
   Procmail can either be installed as the sendmail local delivery
   agent (preferred) or simply executed from the user's .forward file.
   If you're using a recent version of sendmail, no user aliases are
   required.  Versions of sendmail 8.x or later will accept usernames
   containing a plus sign and will deliver them as though the username
   were truncated at the plus sign (it's actually more complicated
   than this--see the Sendmail book mentioned above for complete details).
   For example, sending a message to "tomiii+page@some.domain.name" will
   result in the message going to tomiii's mailbox.  If this doesn't
   work on your system, you will need to create aliases such as:

	<user>-page: <user>

   The following rule in /etc/procmailrc (or .procmailrc in the user's
   home directory) should work nicely with QuickPage:

	:0c
	* ^To: .*[+-]page@
	|/usr/local/bin/qpage -l 0 -m -p $LOGNAME

   This procmail rule will check for a "To:" line that contains a
   username ending with "-page" or "+page" and will invoke qpage to
   handle such messages.  The 'c' in the first line causes procmail to
   also deliver the e-mail message to the user's mailbox in case the
   user's pager is turned off.  The "-l 0" option causes the QuickPage
   daemon to send an e-mail reply containing status information about
   the page to the original sender.  Consult the procmail documentation
   for more information.


QuickPage can also be installed as a sendmail delivery agent.  To do
this requires modifying /etc/sendmail.cf (or /etc/mail/sendmail.cf on
some systems) and should not be attempted without understanding how
sendmail works.  Explaining the syntax requirements of sendmail.cf is
beyond the scope of this document.  However, the O'Reilly "Sendmail"
book (also known as the Bat book) is an excellent reference.  It
contains a wealth of information about sendmail and shows specific
examples on how to modify the sendmail configuration file for programs
such as QuickPage.  For those of you who already understand the details
of sendmail.cf, keep reading; otherwise, stop here and go get yourself
a sendmail book.

If you intend to use QuickPage as a sendmail delivery agent, you'll
need to and create a new mailer definition in sendmail.cf.  Insert the
following line somewhere near the local mailer definition (typically
called Mlocal in most configuration files):

    Mqpage, P=/usr/local/bin/qpage, F=lmsDF, A=qpage -l0 -m -P$u

Note that when using the 'm' flag in the F= portion of the mailer
definition, you'll probably want to use -P instead of -p in the
argument list so that any -a, -c, or -l options you specify will
apply to all recipients.

Now you need to modify ruleset 0 to use this new mailer definition.
The specifics are left for you to decide.  This can be as simple
or as complicated as you want to make it.  One possibility would
be to add rules such as:

    # send local pages to the QuickPage mailer
    R$+.page			$#qpage $: $1
    R$+.page<@$=w>$*		$#qpage $: $1

With these rules and the mailer definition above, a message sent to
user.page or user.page@your.domain.name would cause sendmail to forward
the message to the user's pager by executing the command:

    /usr/local/bin/qpage -l0 -m -Puser

It would be wise to save a backup copy of your existing sendmail.cf
before attempting to make any changes.
