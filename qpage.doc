NAME
     qpage -  SNPP  client/server  for  sending  messages  to  an
     alpha-numeric pager

SYNOPSIS
     qpage [ -dhimQv ] [ -a [+][dd+]hhmm | -a YYMMDDHHMMSS ] [ -c
     coverage  ]  [  -f  from  ] [ -l level ] [ -p pagerid ] [ -P
     pagerid ] [ -s server ] [ message ]

     qpage [ -d ] [ -C config ] -q interval

DESCRIPTION
     QuickPage sends messages to a paging terminal using the SNPP
     and  IXO (also known as TAP) protocols.  It is normally used
     with no options other than a recipient and the message text,
     in  which  case the message is sent to the SNPP server where
     it is submitted to a page queue to be  sent  by  a  separate
     daemon  process.   Page  groups  and duty schedules are sup-
     ported.  Status notification messages indicating the success
     or  failure  of  a page are sent via e-mail to submitters of
     high-priority (level 0) pages.

     If no message is specified on the command line, the user  is
     prompted  for  the  message  text.  Characters are read from
     standard input until a line  containing  only  a  period  is
     received, or until EOF is received.  All occurrences of whi-
     tespace within the message text  are  reduced  to  a  single
     space character.

     Messages received by the QuickPage daemon  that  are  longer
     than the maximum page length (see below) are split into mul-
     tiple segments and sent as  separate  pages.   Each  message
     segment  is  prefixed  with its segment number.  The maximum
     number of segments a into which a message will be  split  is
     configurable.   If  a  message  exceeds this limit, the last
     allowed segment will be prefixed with 't',  indicating  that
     the  message  is  truncated;  otherwise, the last segment is
     prefixed with 'e' to indicate the end of the message.   Mes-
     sages that fit into a single page are not prefixed with seg-
     ment numbers.  All message segments are prefixed  with  CAL-
     Lerid information (see RFC-1861), if available.

OPTIONS
     The following options are supported:

     -a   Send the page at the specified time.  A time specifica-
          tion  prefixed  with  a  plus  sign (+) is added to the
          current time.  The QuickPage daemon will not  send  any
          pages  with  a  timestamp  newer than the current time.
          This feature may be used  to  provide  a  simple  alarm
          clock function for meeting reminders, etc.  This option
          applies only to the pagerid(s) specified by the next -p

          option.   If  the  specified  time  is  in  the  format
          YYMMDDHHMMSS, the two-digit year is interpreted as fol-
          lows:  if the last two digits of the specified year are
          in the range 00-49 and  the  last  two  digits  of  the
          current  year are in the range 50-99, assume the speci-
          fied time is in the next century.  Otherwise assume the
          specified time is in the current century.

     -c   Use a different coverage area or paging service.   This
          option  is  only  useful if the recipient has more than
          one pager and/or more than  one  paging  service.  This
          option  applies only to the pagerid(s) specified by the
          next -p option.

     -C   Specify an alternate configuration file.   This  option
          may only be used on the QuickPage server.

     -d   Debug mode.  Very verbose and probably not  interesting
          for  the  normal  user.   This  option  is provided for
          debugging purposes only.

     -f   Specify who the page is from.   This  option  specifies
          the  argument to the SNPP CALLerid command.  Every mes-
          sage segment will be prefixed with the value  specified
          by this option unless disabled by the msgprefix keyword
          in the configuration file.  A null argument  (  -f  "")
          may  be  specified to suppress the message prefix for a
          particular message.  However, this will  also  suppress
          e-mail  status notification.  The default is the userid
          of the person running QuickPage.

     -h   Help.  Print  a  brief  summary  of  the  command  line
          options.

     -i   Use interactive mode.  The page is sent immediately and
          summary  messages  are printed during the course of the
          transaction.  This option may only be used on a machine
          with  a  physically  attached  modem.   This  option is
          intended for debugging purposes only and should not  be
          used  in a production environment.  The -d option, when
          used in conjunction  with  this  option,  can  be  very
          effective  in troubleshooting problems between the SNPP
          server and the remote paging terminal.

     -l   Specify the service level for this page.   The  service
          level  must  be  a  number between 0 and 11, inclusive.
          The TME protocol specifies service level as follows:

               0 - Priority
               1 - Normal (default)
               2 - Five minutes
               3 - Fifteen minutes

               11 - Carrier specific '4'

          With the exception of level zero, service  levels  have
          no  meaning to QuickPage but they are accepted for com-
          patibility with  other  programs.   Any  service  level
          specified  by the user is passed on to the SNPP server.
          For pages submitted with a service level of  zero,  the
          QuickPage  daemon  will  send  an e-mail message to the
          submitter notifying them  whether  the  page  succeeded
          (i.e.  it  was  successfully  transmitted to the paging
          service) or failed.  This option applies  only  to  the
          pagerid(s) specified by the next -p option.

     -m   This option tells QuickPage to read an  e-mail  message
          from  standard  input.   A  page is constructed by con-
          catenating the From: header (XXX), the Subject:  header
          (YYY),  and  lines  from the message body (ZZZ) as fol-
          lows:

               XXX (Subj: YYY) ZZZ ...

          Minimal support is provided  for  multipart  MIME  mes-
          sages.    The   first  part  with  a  Content-Type:  of
          text/plain will be processed.  The remaining parts will
          be discarded.  This will reduce the problems associated
          with people  accidentally  mailing  binaries  to  their
          pagers.

          The X-sun-attachment type is not supported  and  should
          not  be  used.   MIME is a documented standard.  The X-
          sun-attachment type is neither documented nor standard.
          However,  QuickPage  will  still use the From: and Sub-
          ject: lines (but no message body)  from  such  messages
          for those people who insist on using it anyway.

          A line starting with two dashes  (--)  in  the  message
          body  (or  in  a  MIME  text part) is assumed to be the
          start of a signature and will cause QuickPage  to  stop
          processing the e-mail message at that point.

     -p   Specify the pagerid of the intended recipient.   Multi-
          ple  recipients  may  be  specified by separating their
          pager        IDs        with        commas        (e.g.
          pagerid1,pagerid2,pagerid3).   No  spaces are permitted
          between recipients and the comma separator  characters.

          Any -a, -c, or -l options previously encountered on the
          command line are reset to their  default  values  after
          this option is processed.  This option may occur multi-
          ple times on the command line, each  possibly  preceded
          by different -a, -c, or -l options.

     -P   Like -p but does not reset -a, -c, or -l options previ-
          ously encountered on the command line.

     -q   Start a QuickPage daemon.  This option causes QuickPage
          to  detach itself from the controlling terminal and run
          as a daemon process.  This option requires a  numerical
          argument.   If  the  argument  is greater than zero, it
          specifies the number of seconds QuickPage should  sleep
          between queue runs.  An argument less than zero signals
          QuickPage to accept incoming SNPP connections and write
          new  pages  to the page queue, but to never process the
          page queue.  An argument of zero signals QuickPage  not
          to listen for incoming SNPP connections, but to process
          the page queue one time and then exit.  See  the  NOTES
          section below for more information.

     -Q   Print the current contents of  the  page  queue.   This
          option  may  only  be  used  on  the  QuickPage server.
          Unless invoked by root or DAEMONUSER, this option  will
          probably fail because of insufficient permissions.

     -s   Specify the name(s) of the SNPP server(s).   The  host-
          names  used  by a client to contact a server are deter-
          mined by checking the following in this order:

               the -s option
               the environment variable SNPP_SERVER
               the contents of the compiled in filename
               the compiled in hostname

          Multiple hostnames are  permitted  by  separating  them
          with  commas.   If  multiple  servers  are  used, it is
          assumed that they all have identical copies of the con-
          figuration file.

     -v   Print the version of QuickPage and exit.

     The QuickPage server requires a  configuration  file.   This
     file  is read one time during startup and again upon receipt
     of SIGHUP.  The configuration file is made up of  major  and
     minor keyword=value pairs.  Major keywords must start at the
     beginning of a line.  Minor keywords  must  contain  leading
     whitespace.   All keywords must be immediately followed with
     an equal sign (=).  Spaces are permitted between  the  equal
     sign  and  the value.  The value may not contain whitespace.
     Keywords may appear in any order  with  the  following  four

     exceptions:

          Minor keywords must be  grouped  together  under  their
          respective major keyword.

          ence them.

          Services must be defined before any pagers that  refer-

          Pagers must be defined before any groups that reference

     The major keywords are:

          administrator  The  e-mail  address  of  the  QuickPage
                         administrator.    If   defined,   e-mail
                         notification will be sent to the  Quick-
                         Page administrator whenever a page fails
                         (i.e. when maxtries has been  exceeded).
                         This  address is also used in the Reply-

                         priority pages.

          forcehostname  (true, false, or  @mailhost)  Force  the
                         destination address to be qualified with
                         a hostname when  sending  e-mail  status
                         notification  to users.  This option can
                         be used when  the  QuickPage  daemon  is
                         running  on a machine that does not han-
                         dle   unqualified    e-mail    addresses
                         correctly.  If the value of this keyword
                         starts with the '@' character,  it  will
                         be  appended as-is to unqualified e-mail
                         addresses.  If the value of this keyword
                         is  "true" then the submitter's hostname
                         will be appended to such addresses.  The
                         default  is  false  (do not append host-
                         names).

          identtimeout   The number of  seconds  to  wait  for  a

                         queries.  An integer less than or  equal
                         to  zero  disables  ident functionality.
                         The default is 10 seconds.

          include        If present, this keyword  specifies  the
                         name  of another configuration file that
                         should be processed at this point.  Pro-

                         cessed.   QuickPage  makes no attempt to
                         prevent infinite recursion; do  not  use
                         this  keyword  in  multiple  files  that
                         point at each other.

          pidfile        If present,  this  keyword  specifies  a
                         file  into which the server should write
                         its process ID.   The  file  is  is  not
                         opened until after root permissions have
                         been dropped.  If DAEMONUSER cannot open
                         the  file  for  writing  (or if the file
                         does not exist and DAEMONUSER  does  not
                         have permission to create it), this key-
                         word is silently ignored.

          sigfile        If present,  this  keyword  specifies  a
                         file  containing  an alternate signature
                         that QuickPage should append  to  e-mail
                         status  notification  messages  sent  to
                         page submitters.  Use  sigfile=/dev/null
                         to suppress the signature completely.

          synchronous    (true or false)  Whether  or  not  queue
                         runs  are  synchronized  with new pages.
                         If true, the submission of  a  new  page
                         initiates  a  queue  run without waiting
                         for the normal sleep counter (set by the
                         -q  option).   If  false,  the  page  is
                         queued and the server waits for the time
                         remaining  on the sleep counter (if any)
                         before starting another queue run.   The
                         default is true.

          lockdir        The  location  of  the  lock  directory.
                         This keyword may be used to override the
                         compiled in location of the lock  direc-
                         tory.   It should rarely be necessary to
                         specify this keyword.

          snpptimeout    The number of seconds  to  wait  for  an
                         SNPP command before terminating the con-
                         nection.  The default is 60 seconds.

          queuedir       The location of the page  queue.   There
                         is  no  default  queue  directory;  this
                         option must be specified in  the  confi-

                                        underscores are converted
                                        to  spaces when the value
                                        of this keyword is  read.

                                        within a single group.

     The service named  "default"  always  exists  (even  if  not
     specified  in  the  configuration  file) and has the default
     values listed above.  However, the default  service  may  be
     redefined in the configuration file if desired.

     Member definitions within a page group have the syntax:

          member=name[/DayStart-End]

     Where  the  square  brackets  indicate  an   optional   duty
     schedule.  The duty schedule has the same syntax as the Time
     parameter in the UUCP Systems file:  Day is a list of  case-
     sensitive  weekday abbreviations (e.g. MoTuTh), Start is the
     start time (e.g. 800), and End is the end time (e.g.  1700).
     The word Any is synonymous with SuMoTuWeThFrSa. Midnight may
     be represented as either 0 or 2400.  The time range must not
     span  across  midnight.  A slash is required to separate the
     duty schedule from the member name.  Multiple member defini-
     tions  for the same person with different duty schedules are
     permitted  (see  the  example  below).    Overlapping   duty
     schedules  for the same person within a group will not cause
     duplicate pages to be sent to that person.  See the  follow-
     ing example configuration file:

NOTES
     The order of the command line options is important.  The -a,
     -c, and -l options must precede the pagerids they refer to.

     The -p option resets -a, -c, and -l to their default  values
     after it is processed.  If this behavior is not desired, use
     -P instead.

     All 8-bit characters are stripped to 7 bits before they  are
     transmitted  to the paging service, regardless of the parity
     setting defined in the configuration file.  Also,  all  con-
     trol  characters  (ASCII  values  between 0x00 and 0x20) are
     "escaped" as specified by the IXO/TAP protocol.  Escaping is
     done  by  converting  each  control character into two bytes
     consisting of a SUB (0x1A) character followed by the  print-
     able  ASCII  character  formed  by  adding 0x40 to the ASCII
     value of the control character.  Thus, Ctrl-A is transmitted
     as the two-byte sequence 0x1A, 0x41.

     The QuickPage daemon listens for incoming  SNPP  connections
     and periodically processes the page queue.  A separate child
     process is created on demand to handle each incoming request
     and each queue run.

     After a page is accepted, the child  sends  SIGUSR1  to  its
     parent  forcing  it to start a queue run immediately without
     waiting for the time specified by -q.  If desired, this sig-
     nal  can  be  suppressed  using  the  "synchronous"  keyword
     described above.

     The page queue is locked during queue runs to prevent multi-
     ple processes from competing for modem resources.

     The QuickPage SNPP daemon supports a proprietary  XWHO  com-
     mand  not  documented  in  the  official  SNPP  protocol  as
     described in RFC-1861.  XWHO takes no arguments and  returns
     a multi-line response of the form:

          214 pager1 text1
          214 pager2 text2
          214 pager3 text3
           .
           .
           .
          214 pagerN textN
          250

     where the first word after the 214 response code is the name
     of  a  pager  or  page  group,  followed by the value of the
     corresponding text keyword (with  underscores  converted  to
     spaces)  from  the  configuration  file.   Pager  and  group
     specifications that do not have the text keyword defined  in
     the  configuration  file  will  not  be included in the XWHO
     response.  The purpose of the XWHO command is to allow  SNPP
     clients  to present users with a list of possible recipients
     and their names  or  descriptions.   XWHO  is  supported  by
     QuickPage  in  an  attempt  to  overcome  the  current  SNPP
     protocol's deficiency.  If the protocol is ever  revised  in
     the  future  to  include this functionality, support for the
     XWHO command will be dropped in favor of whatever facilities
     are  specified  at  that  time.  Software developers writing
     their own SNPP clients should be advised that the XWHO  com-
     mand  is  not stable and may be removed from future releases
     of QuickPage without notice.

     If the CALLerid information received by the QuickPage daemon
     contains  the '@' character, it is truncated at that charac-
     ter before being prepended to messages.  However, it is used
     as-is for the destination address when sending e-mail notif-
     ication for high-priority recipients.

     Due to the protocol limitations of SNPP,  QuickPage  derives
     e-mail notification addresses from the CALLerid information.
     Since the CALLerid information might be  bogus,  all  e-mail
     notifications are sent using a null reverse path.  This will
     prevent error messages from being generated by the mail sys-
     tem if a bogus address is used for e-mail notification.

     If the server does not receive a CALLerid command  (sent  by
     the QuickPage client unless -f"" is specified on the command
     line) notification messages will not be sent, regardless  of
     the specified service level.

     When the -m flag is used to send a high-priority  page,  the
     status  notification  is  sent  to the return address in the
     original e-mail message unless overridden by the -f option.

     The length of SNPP commands is limited only by the amount of
     memory available to QuickPage.

     QuickPage uses a timeout of 255 seconds while waiting for  a
     connection  from the remote modem.  This allows the adminis-
     trator to specify an  appropriate  timeout  by  setting  the
     modem's S7 register in the dial command.

     The modem must control the CD (carrier-detect) line.  Other-
     wise,  the  on/off hook status of the modem cannot be deter-
     mined.  This is especially important if more than one paging
     service  is used since QuickPage must be able to detect when
     it's safe to send dial commands to the modem.

KNOWN BUGS
     Pages are not queued on the client side.  As a result, if no
     servers  are  available  to the client at the time a page is
     submitted, an error message is printed and the page is  dis-
     carded.

     Pages received after a queue run has  started  will  not  be
     processed until the following queue run.

     The default service requires a phone keyword (just like  the
     rest  of  the service definitions), even if no pager entries
     specifically reference the default service.

     Because QuickPage must read the configuration file to deter-
     mine the location of the page queue, the -Q option will only
     work for users with appropriate access to the  modems,  page
     queue, and lock directory.
